Manual for performing pentests.

The idea is quite simple actually. Or is it better to say, the reason behind it?

Often I don't know what to do, what to look for and so on. I read a lot of books, which, make it look simple, such as "Run Nmap, learn it's OS version, lookup the exploit, run it and get your root". It is the essence of it practically. However, the reason it doesn't turn out like this, some things go wrong (if not all).

First of all, the enumeration process doesn't show up anything. Either because the target is behind some firewall, or something is really wrong. Second, Even if you discover some open ports and land some OS version info, you don't know what to do next. What vulnerabilities do exist for the platform/OS/application? Even if you google them, the list is too long, sometimes you don't know what you need. Assuming that you did find the vulnerability you need, the next step is
finding the correct exploit. There are some problems with that, starting from no exploit, to exploit which may cause harm to the system. Assuming that you did find exploit, you don't know how it works, or how to start it. After some more time lost, you get the exploit fired up, you choose the target ip, port, you get ready for the big moment, and... nothing happens. The exploit doesn't work. You have to start all over again.

Even if the exploit did work, you get root (YAY!). What's next? You either post exploit the machine, or you notify about the vulnerability, and ideally tell about how to patch it.

There are so many things could go wrong. That's why it would be nice to have a manual for pentesting. It would reflect all of my past experience, and at the same time would serve as a checklist on what I have to do at the given moment of pentest.

However, there is another problem with it. Whether it should be publically available? People who don't appreciate security might abuse it to cause harm to many people. That's a question, I don't have answer to.
