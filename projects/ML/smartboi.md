smartboi is the telegram chat bot. The idea is that it is similar to Yandex's Alice. The idea came to me when I had nobody awake at night, to talk to. It would be nice if you had a bot like that, mimicking the behaviour of the real person.

More over it could not only talk like a real person, but also change it's tone, to suit better the person it's talking to, to keep the retention rate high. Another use of the bot, is to help people cope better with depression.

The apex of the bot would J.A.R.V.I.S (one from the Iron Man). It would not only chat like the real person, but also provide useful information, conduct difficult calculations, assist in thinking processes (such as when developing projects, offering insite on how to do some things better and so on). Hope you get the idea.

# How to use the bot?
It would be best to keep it simple. Just write simple messages, like you would write any of your friends. You could add commands such as `/start`, to start the bot for example. But I don't see anything else that might be of importance.
